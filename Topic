 //The command above creates a new topic named topic1 with 6 partitions. Each cluster will be responsible for 2 partitions. The replication-factor has been set to 1, which means data is not being replicated and the data for a particular partition will only be stored on one server.
 //get a list of all existing topics
 
 bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper kafka1:2181
 
 
 
 //get a detailed description of our topic.
 bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --zookeeper kafka1:2181 --topic topic1
 
 
 
 //Test the cluster
 //The Kafka package already includes two command line tools to create a producer and a consumer that can be used to check if the cluster works.
// We can start the producer on one of our servers. The command opens a prompt and anything we enter here will be sent to the topic.

bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list kafka1:9092 --topic topic1



// start a consumer on one of our servers.

 bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server kafka1:9092 --topic topic1
 
 
 //Whenever we enter something in the producer prompt it will be printed out in our consumer terminal.

 // This means our test was successful, the Kafka cluster has been set up
